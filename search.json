    "text": "Welcome to my website!\nWelcome! I’m Spancer Zhou, a Master’s student in Bioinformatics at Case Western Reserve University, where I am fortunate to work under the mentorship of Dr. Gurkan Bebek. With a passion for uncovering insights at the intersection of computational biology and neuroscience, I am currently focusing on multi-omics integration. My research involves analyzing RNA-seq data from 5xFAD mouse models (cortex and hippocampus tissues at 4, 8, and 12 months) alongside proteomics datasets. These efforts aim to uncover molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, which hold the potential to inform precision medicine strategies.\nPreviously, I graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies, specializing in Environment and Health, where I honed my skills in computational and experimental biology. I’ve contributed to projects ranging from predictive modeling of cell surface protein abundance using scRNA-seq data to exploring deep learning techniques for understanding proteomic variability. These experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in data analysis, programming, and biological interpretation.\nAlthough I am in the early stages of my academic journey, I am committed to continuous growth and exploration. I plan to pursue a Ph.D. to deepen my expertise and contribute to the broader field of bioinformatics, with a long-term vision of advancing our understanding of complex biological systems.\nBeyond my academic pursuits, I’m an avid traveler who finds inspiration in road trips and exploring new landscapes. I believe that these experiences enrich my perspective and fuel creativity, both in research and in life.\nFeel free to reach out contact me to discuss collaboration opportunities, research interests, or simply to connect!\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
